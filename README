This repo will configure xmonad on ubuntu.

QUICK GUIDE
   $ make install
   $ mkdir -p ~/bin ; cp xmonad.start ~/bin/xmonad.start
   Log out, select the xmonad with your user name from GDM. DONE.

I use it to sync xmonad configs on any ubuntu computer I'm using as a desktop.
If you've got xmonad and ubuntu installed and up to date, this will get you up
and running with xmonad in about five minutes.

Ubuntu ships with a reasonable gnome setup.  This includes using Nautilus in a
Windows/Mac style bid to control many facets of the UI.  Nautilus opens up a
window that will hover over all other windows.  You can move it around by
holding meta ( ALT ), holding mouse three and dragging the window.  The make
file includes handy targets to control this feature of Nautilus.

Ubuntu's startup is a complicated process.  The method we use is to install a
desktop description file in the canonical location [ /usr/share/xsessions ].
This makes it available to you as a selection when GDM asks you to log in.
The desktop description tells GDM to use a script of our making.  It serves
the same purpose as all those xsession / xinit and myriad variations.

Configuring XMonad
I use the defaults.
Here is the entire file:
-------------------------

import XMonad

main = xmonad defaultConfig
     {
       terminal = "xterm"
     }

------
-- EOF

Make targets:
  show-nautilus-desktop
    Issue a command that tells Nautilus to turn it's desktop feature back on.
  hide-nautilus-desktop
    Issue a command that tells Nautilus to turn it's desktop feature OFF.
  install
    Generate and Install our desktop file, disable the Nautilus desktop. 
    Install our xmonad.hs in the right place.
  desktop
    Show the results of generating a desktop file.
