TODO: Move this elsewhere.

Using itsalltext with firefox makes for a great combiation.  I've got a script
in http://bitbucket.org/bewest/homeware/src/tip/bin/texteditor and give it to
itsalltext.  Any textarea in a window gets a button that opens vim in a window
next to firefox, allowing me to edit my message in a proper editor while
continuing to browse or look at the page in context.
